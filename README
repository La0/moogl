A basic WebGL engine in mootools style.

I do not aim for speed, but for code simplicity.

It's a simple wrapper/tookit/helper around webGL (low level of abstraction), and as so, might be use in a educational way when learning webGL.


I wrote this code while reading this blog http://learningwebgl.com/, which is a very clear source of information for 3D /webGL beginners.


Current status is : 
    * blank page
->  * working draft
    * API sealed
    * alpha release


Note, moogl is mootools-webgl / sound like "moogle", so for now, i'll use the fluffy Final Fantasy creature as subtle logo
